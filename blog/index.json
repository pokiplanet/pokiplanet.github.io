Officially known as the E4 Art \u0026amp; Illustration Contest, it invites participants of all skill levels to submit artwork in four diverse categories. The contest is free to enter, encourages participation from both novice and experienced artists, and emphasizes inclusivity, welcoming original creations, childlike drawings, and digital art.\nThis is the first time i will be entering. but not for myself, for my 8 year old daughter Leila (Lee-la) She is a fantastic little artist with her own style and enjoys spending time drawing on paper as well as digitally on her tablet. Regardless of the results on the forum i am planning on creating her a card featuring her art for her as well as a prize for her effort.\nI entered her into 2 category\u0026rsquo;s i thought she would excel at\nChild Drawing Recreation Recreation #\rShe first set out at Recreation, i asked her what her favorite Pokemon was and she said Eevee \u0026amp; Pikachu. i visited pkmncards.com on my Laptop and showed her Eevee cards and Pikachu cards until she chose one to draw, She chose the common Generations Pikachu illustrated by Atsuko Nishida. Atsuko Nishida is one of my favorite artist\u0026rsquo;s, maybe my #1.. though it\u0026rsquo;s hard to choose.\nThroughout my TCG collecting there has been many times i\u0026rsquo;ve come across a card art that really grabs my attention and it turns out to be Atsuko Nishida. So i was especially surprised when she chose this card and again i look down and see it\u0026rsquo;s Nishida. She said she likes the style and that it\u0026rsquo;s similar to hers. I downloaded the image, cropped it and sent it to her tablet for her to recreate.\nI left her to it for a while but checked on her from time to time to see how she was doing, i could see she was excited and knew exactly what she was going to do for this art piece. She loves drawing her own things with her own style, this is the first time she has ever drawn Pokemon.\nShe showed me the finished piece, and we are both very happy with it. She was literally bouncing up and down with excitement and pride with what she had done. I am also very proud of her, especially since this has all been self taught. In my opinion she is extremely talented and has a great imagination.\nLeila\u0026rsquo;s Pikachu #\rThat was enough for now, she worked hard on it and was eager to continue, but it was time for bed.\nChild Drawing #\rShe had free reign now, she can draw in her own style and im excited to see what she will produce.\n[28 June 2025]\nThis one took her the longest, she finished just in time for the submission period opening up for the contest!\nI am immensely proud of her and will be rewarding her for her efforts!\nEevee Espresso #\rCard i made for her featuring her art\rYou can view the contest thread over on efour\nI am grateful for the community over at efour for hosting the event again and immensely proud of my daughter Leila for her submissions!\nWin or loose, it created many great family memories and hopefully one she won\u0026rsquo;t forget as she gets older.\nLeila - Age 8\rPast Artwork #\rIf you would like to see some more of her art here are a few pieces i pulled from her tablet.\nComments from the contest #\r[22 July 2025]\nThe Results are in #\rE4 ART CONTEST 2025 Thread! (Results! ! !)\nThe competition was tough, everyone\u0026rsquo;s submissions were well put together. Leila received an honorable mention for being within a few votes to the top 3. I am very proud of her work especially since she was drawing pokemon for the first time. I hope she would like to enter again next year.\nFor her reward i will be taking her to her favorite restaurant, Cosmo. She enjoys the sushi there.\nWe went the week after the the results were announced and she had a great time :)\nHave thoughts or questions? Curious about this topic?

Released in North America on January 9, 1999, by Wizards of the Coast, the Base Set was the first English-language set of Pokémon cards, adapted from the Japanese Pokémon Card Game launched by Media Factory in 1996. The Base Set introduced players to the original 151 Pokémon from the Pokémon Red and Blue video games, with Venusaur 15/102 being one of the set’s flagship holographic (holo) cards. Venusaur, alongside Charizard and Blastoise, forms the \u0026ldquo;Big 3\u0026rdquo; of the Base Set—three iconic Stage 2 Pokémon that became the most coveted cards due to their rarity, power, and cultural significance. These cards represent the final evolutions of the starter Pokémon from the Pokémon Red and Blue games (Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle), resonating deeply with fans of the franchise. The Unlimited print, while not as scarce as First Edition, was still highly sought after due to its holographic shine and the nostalgia tied to the early Pokémon craze of the late 1990s.\nLooking for more? #\rYou can view my personal collection here Have thoughts or questions?

I submitted a post on elitefourum.com and continued my research, but ultimately hit a dead end.\nNow a Collectible #\rMore recently, in 2025, this item has become something of a collectible. More and more collectors are searching for information about it, and while more are appearing on the secondhand market, the travel case remained a mystery. Knowledge of its existence has primarily circulated through online forums, Reddit threads, and collector groups often accompanied by vague recollections.\nPersonal Research #\rAs someone who personally owned this case, I recall purchasing it as part of a Pokémon Emerald bundle from a Toys “R” Us store in the UK. However, unlike what I had heard from others, I don’t remember purchasing a Game Boy Advance SP with it, I already owned one and just purchased the game.\nUsing Archive.org’s Wayback Machine, I searched archived versions of the UK Toys “R” Us website from around the game’s release. After combing through dozens of captures, I still couldn’t find any promotional material on their homepage, so I switched to a more in-depth search of their product pages. Finally, I found it.\nScreenshot from archive.org - Jan-03-2006\rThough the image quality was poor, this confirmed what my memory had preserved: this case was a Toys “R” Us exclusive.\nThe listing reads:\nGBA Pokémon Emerald\nLong-awaited Pokémon Emerald plus exclusive Travel Case.\nUnfortunately, the actual listing itself has not been archived, and I still haven’t managed to find any additional information. However, I do remember there being promotional material in-store at Toys “R” Us at the time, so hopefully more will surface in the future.\nDetails of the Case #\rHere’s what is known about the case:\nMaterial: Metal shell Design: Custom-molded to snugly fit a GBA SP. Strap: Green nylon/fabric strap Availability: Bundled with Pokémon Emerald at Toys “R” Us UK stores (and possibly through their website). Era: Released alongside the European release of Pokémon Emerald around October 21, 2005. Sold out by 2006 Inside: Contains two grey foam inserts (top and bottom) for padding; lined with smooth black fabric Conclusion #\rThe Rayquaza Game Boy Advance SP travel case serves as a reminder of a time when gaming accessories were more regionally unique and often fleeting in availability. While it may not have the recognition of limited-edition consoles or tournament prizes, its rarity and connection to one of the most beloved Pokémon titles give it a unique place in collecting history.\nThanks to tools like Archive.org and the dedication of nostalgic fans, small fragments of gaming history like this continue to be uncovered and appreciated. If you happen to own one, consider yourself lucky, you hold a piece of forgotten Pokémon memorabilia that many are still searching for more information about.\nHave thoughts or questions?

These late EX-series packs were produced before the full transition into the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl sets and can be a significant treat for collectors, as they tend to be harder to find today.\nLikely Booster Packs Included: #\rThe contents of the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Trainer Kit varied over time and across different print runs, but here are the key booster packs you might find:\nDiamond \u0026amp; Pearl Base Set Most common pack to be included, as this is the core set of the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era.\nMysterious Treasures Second most common pack to appear, also from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl block, and highly sought after by players due to the unique cards it includes (like Electivire and Mew).\nSecret Wonders A slightly rarer pack that introduces several beloved cards and mechanics from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era.\nGreat Encounters Another set from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era, notable for powerful cards like Garchomp and Lugia.\nMajestic Dawn Less common in packs but still a possibility, known for powerful Legendary Pokémon and cards like Dialga and Palkia.\nLate EX Series Packs: #\rBeyond the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl sets, some Trainer Kits were reported to contain booster packs from the later EX-series, particularly from 2005–2007. These were part of the tail end of the EX era, and getting one of these packs adds significant rarity and potential value to the Trainer Kit. The most notable packs include:\nEX Holon Phantoms Rarity: Relatively rare but occasionally included in later print runs of the Trainer Kits.\nEX Power Keepers Rarity: Sometimes included in Trainer Kits, though less frequently than Holon Phantoms.\nEX Legend Maker Rarity: Less common, but still possible to find in Trainer Kits.\nEX Deoxys Rarity: Very rare in the Trainer Kit, but certainly possible.\nLikely Pack Combinations: #\rThe most common packs will still be from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era, as those were the sets in active circulation when the Trainer Kits were released.\nEX-series packs are considered rarer, but can sometimes be found so it’s more of a special bonus for those lucky enough to find one.\nThe following breakdown is not official, just what we can assume from current data available.\nRarity Breakdown: Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Base Set – ~50% chance (most common)\nMysterious Treasures – ~20-25% chance\nSecret Wonders – ~15-20% chance\nGreat Encounters – ~10-15% chance\nMajestic Dawn – ~5-10% chance\nEX Holon Phantoms – ~5% chance (rarer)\nEX Power Keepers – ~5% chance (rarer)\nEX Legend Maker / EX Deoxys – \u0026lt;5% chance (very rare)\nConclusion: #\rThe Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Trainer Kit is primarily designed around the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl series, but it’s certainly possible to find late EX-series packs mixed in, particularly in certain batches of the product.

I wanted to ensure I wasn’t about to open something that had been messed with.\nWhilst inspecting, I noticed that the edge of the booster pack was visible through the side of the plastic. The light hit it just right, and I could make out enough of the artwork to start formulating a guess about which set it could be from.\nAfter a closer look at the booster pack’s art, I began comparing it with the different pack arts from all the sets we previously covered what it could be. There are a lot of possibilities, and I ended up thinking the pack featured Kabutops, The colors and design seemed to line up, and I grew confident that I had an EX Holon Phantoms pack in my hands.\nI decided to open the kit and record it for fun, sort of like a booster pack opening! You can watch the full opening on my YouTube:\nUnwrapping the kit, I was greeted with a surprise: it wasn’t Kabutops after all. Instead, the pack featured Zangoose!\nThough I had been wrong about the pack art, I wasn’t disappointed in the slightest! It was still an EX Holon Phantoms pack like i had hoped for, and it felt like a stroke of luck that I’d pulled a pack from this sought-after set.

At the time, there was barely any information about it online, so I dug deeper and decided to create a post documenting the card on EliteFourum. That post gained significant attention within the collecting community. Some collectors had already noticed the variant and had been quietly acquiring them for years.\nThe new information I shared prompted more collectors to come forward with additional research and insights into this mysterious card. Eventually, this community effort led to collectors formally requesting that the grading company CGC recognize the variant using my article as a key reference point.\nThanks to the support of the collectors at EliteFourum and the research I contributed, CGC officially recognized the card as a variant on February 9th, 2021. They even published their own article on the subject, which you can read here:\n👉 CGC article on the Black Flame Ninetales\nSince then the card has become more recognized in the community as well as other leading grading companies have officially recognized the variant too like PSA.\nI’m incredibly proud to have made a lasting impact on the Pokémon TCG community and grateful to the fellow collectors at EliteFourum who helped along the way.\nBelow is a copy of the original article I wrote five years ago. For more discussion and collector insights, I highly recommend checking out the original thread here:\n🔗 The Black Flame Ninetales – EliteFourum\nOriginal Article (October 2020) #\rThe Black Flame Ninetales #\rFor those that are seeing this for the first time it’s an Unlimited Base Set Ninetales (12/102) but the flame around Ninetales is black instead of purple.\n(See side by side comparison below)\nAfter searching ebay for a few month’s checking every Ninetales card listed i managed to find one on a BIN and scooped it up, Having it in hand i was now determined to find out some more information about it starting with evidence of it being pulled from a pack.\nIt took a while searching through pack opening videos for every time a Ninetales was pulled but i finally found one being pulled from 6 years a go!\nPrimetimePokemon’s Pull (Timestamp: 10:52)\rSee also LeonHart’s pack opening video found by @jkanly\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0MU7sAmMVY\nYou can see in these video’s that the Booster Packs being opened are;\nIdentifying Shadowless \u0026amp; Unlimited Base set Boxes \u0026amp; Packs\nMade in the U.S.A., “1999-2000” copywrites, Short seal pack: There is no evidence this card comes from any other pack as of yet.\nError or Variant? #\rMy initial theory was that it’s an error card since the packs it comes from are a late print of Unlimited but the Black Flame is not present on previous print runs of Unlimited, leading me to speculate that it was a possible printing error.\nHowever keep in mind that a 1999-2000 Base Set Booster Pack is not guaranteed to have a 1999-2000 print Holo card inside, it has been rumoured that the non-2000 print holo’s inside the packs are old stock, Possibly from an early print run of Unlimited. This would make the most sense as the Black Flame Ninetales shares it’s black flame with the Shadowless \u0026amp; 1st Edition versions and it is also not a 1999-2000 print holo.\nAdditional Information #\rThe black flame is also clearly visible on all 1st Edition, Shadowless, Japanese Base Set \u0026amp; Evolutions Ninetales as well. These are the only other prints that contain the black flame that i have found. All other Languages of Unlimited Base Set as well as the 1999-2000 Print, Base Set 2 \u0026amp; Legendary Collection Ninetales have the purple flame.\nI would still love to find out more about this card.

There is still a ton i don’t know but i am grateful for the efour community teaching me new things daily so please let me know if anything is wrong \u0026amp; i will correct it.
