Officially known as the E4 Art \u0026amp; Illustration Contest, it invites participants of all skill levels to submit artwork in four diverse categories. The contest is free to enter, encourages participation from both novice and experienced artists, and emphasizes inclusivity, welcoming original creations, childlike drawings, and digital art.\nThis is the first time i will be entering. but not for myself, for my 8 year old daughter Leila (Lee-la) She is a fantastic little artist with her own style and enjoys spending time drawing on paper as well as digitally on her tablet. Regardless of the results on the forum i am planning on creating her a card featuring her art for her as well as a prize for her effort.\nI entered her into 2 category\u0026rsquo;s i thought she would excel at\nChild Drawing Recreation Recreation #\rShe first set out at Recreation, i asked her what her favorite Pokemon was and she said Eevee \u0026amp; Pikachu. i visited pkmncards.com on my Laptop and showed her Eevee cards and Pikachu cards until she chose one to draw, She chose the common Generations Pikachu illustrated by Atsuko Nishida. Atsuko Nishida is one of my favorite artist\u0026rsquo;s, maybe my #1.. though it\u0026rsquo;s hard to choose.\nThroughout my TCG collecting there has been many times i\u0026rsquo;ve come across a card art that really grabs my attention and it turns out to be Atsuko Nishida. So i was especially suriprised when she chose this card and again i look down and see it\u0026rsquo;s Nishida. She said she likes the style and that it\u0026rsquo;s similar to hers. I downloaded the image, cropped it and sent it to her tablet for her to recreate.\nI left her to it for a while but checked on her from time to time to see how she was doing, i could see she was excited and knew exactly what she was going to do for this art piece. She loves drawing her own things with her own style, this is the first time she has ever drawn Pokemon.\nShe showed me the finished piece, and we are both very happy with it. She was literally bouncing up and down with excitement and pride with what she had done. I am also very proud of her, especially since this has all been self taught. In my opinion she is extremely talented and has a great imagination.\nLeila\u0026rsquo;s Pikachu #\rThat was enough for now, she worked hard on it and was eager to continue, but it was time for bed.\nChild Drawing #\rShe had free reign now, she can draw in her own style and im excited to see what she will produce.\n[28 June 2025]\nThis one took her the longest, she finished just in time for the submission period opening up for the contest!\nI am immensely proud of her and will be rewarding her for her efforts!\nEevee Espresso #\rCard i made for her featuring her art\rYou can view the contest thread over on efour\nI am grateful for the community over at efour for hosting the event again and immensely proud of my daughter Leila for her submissions!\nWin or loose, it created many great family memories and hopefully one she won\u0026rsquo;t forget as she gets older.\nLeila - Age 8\rPast Artwork #\rIf you would like to see some more of her art here are a few pieces i pulled from her tablet.\n","date":"28 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/e4-art-contest-2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"E4 Art \u0026 Illustration Contest 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"PokiPlanet Blog","summary":"","title":"PokiPlanet Blog","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"28 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/collection/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Collection","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/history/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"History","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/japanese-promo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Japanese Promo","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/psa/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PSA","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rDragonite FB (018/DPt-P) Beat of the Frontier Release Commemoration Tournament Prize\rAbout #\rThe 2009 Beat of the Frontier Release Commemoration Tournament, part of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game (TCG) Challenge Hiroba events in Japan, was held to celebrate the release of the Beat of the Frontier expansion (released in English as Supreme Victors) on March 6, 2009.

I submitted a post on elitefourum.com and continued my research, but ultimately hit a dead end.\nNow a Collectible #\rMore recently, in 2025, this item has become something of a collectible. More and more collectors are searching for information about it, and while more are appearing on the secondhand market, the travel case remained a mystery. Knowledge of its existence has primarily circulated through online forums, Reddit threads, and collector groups often accompanied by vague recollections.\nPersonal Research #\rAs someone who personally owned this case, I recall purchasing it as part of a Pok√©mon Emerald bundle from a Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us store in the UK. However, unlike what I had heard from others, I don‚Äôt remember purchasing a Game Boy Advance SP with it, I already owned one and just purchased the game.\nUsing Archive.org‚Äôs Wayback Machine, I searched archived versions of the UK Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us website from around the game‚Äôs release. After combing through dozens of captures, I still couldn‚Äôt find any promotional material on their homepage, so I switched to a more in-depth search of their product pages. Finally, I found it.\nScreenshot from archive.org - Jan-03-2006\rThough the image quality was poor, this confirmed what my memory had preserved: this case was a Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us exclusive.\nThe listing reads:\nGBA Pok√©mon Emerald\nLong-awaited Pok√©mon Emerald plus exclusive Travel Case.\nUnfortunately, the actual listing itself has not been archived, and I still haven‚Äôt managed to find any additional information. However, I do remember there being promotional material in-store at Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us at the time, so hopefully more will surface in the future.\nDetails of the Case #\rHere‚Äôs what is known about the case:\nMaterial: Metal shell Design: Custom-molded to snugly fit a GBA SP. Strap: Green nylon/fabric strap Availability: Bundled with Pok√©mon Emerald at Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us UK stores (and possibly through their website). Era: Released alongside the European release of Pok√©mon Emerald around October 21, 2005. Sold out by 2006 Inside: Contains two grey foam inserts (top and bottom) for padding; lined with smooth black fabric Conclusion #\rThe Rayquaza Game Boy Advance SP travel case serves as a reminder of a time when gaming accessories were more regionally unique and often fleeting in availability. While it may not have the recognition of limited-edition consoles or tournament prizes, its rarity and connection to one of the most beloved Pok√©mon titles give it a unique place in collecting history.\nThanks to tools like Archive.org and the dedication of nostalgic fans, small fragments of gaming history like this continue to be uncovered and appreciated. If you happen to own one, consider yourself lucky, you hold a piece of forgotten Pok√©mon memorabilia that many are still searching for more information about.\nHave thoughts or questions?

These late EX-series packs were produced before the full transition into the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl sets and can be a significant treat for collectors, as they tend to be harder to find today.\nLikely Booster Packs Included: #\rThe contents of the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Trainer Kit varied over time and across different print runs, but here are the key booster packs you might find:\nDiamond \u0026amp; Pearl Base Set Most common pack to be included, as this is the core set of the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era.\nMysterious Treasures Second most common pack to appear, also from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl block, and highly sought after by players due to the unique cards it includes (like Electivire and Mew).\nSecret Wonders A slightly rarer pack that introduces several beloved cards and mechanics from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era.\nGreat Encounters Another set from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era, notable for powerful cards like Garchomp and Lugia.\nMajestic Dawn Less common in packs but still a possibility, known for powerful Legendary Pok√©mon and cards like Dialga and Palkia.\nLate EX Series Packs: #\rBeyond the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl sets, some Trainer Kits were reported to contain booster packs from the later EX-series, particularly from 2005‚Äì2007. These were part of the tail end of the EX era, and getting one of these packs adds significant rarity and potential value to the Trainer Kit. The most notable packs include:\nEX Holon Phantoms Rarity: Relatively rare but occasionally included in later print runs of the Trainer Kits.\nEX Power Keepers Rarity: Sometimes included in Trainer Kits, though less frequently than Holon Phantoms.\nEX Legend Maker Rarity: Less common, but still possible to find in Trainer Kits.\nEX Deoxys Rarity: Very rare in the Trainer Kit, but certainly possible.\nLikely Pack Combinations: #\rThe most common packs will still be from the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl era, as those were the sets in active circulation when the Trainer Kits were released.\nEX-series packs are considered rarer, but can sometimes be found so it‚Äôs more of a special bonus for those lucky enough to find one.\nThe following breakdown is not official, just what we can assume from current data available.\nRarity Breakdown: Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Base Set ‚Äì ~50% chance (most common)\nMysterious Treasures ‚Äì ~20-25% chance\nSecret Wonders ‚Äì ~15-20% chance\nGreat Encounters ‚Äì ~10-15% chance\nMajestic Dawn ‚Äì ~5-10% chance\nEX Holon Phantoms ‚Äì ~5% chance (rarer)\nEX Power Keepers ‚Äì ~5% chance (rarer)\nEX Legend Maker / EX Deoxys ‚Äì \u0026lt;5% chance (very rare)\nConclusion: #\rThe Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Trainer Kit is primarily designed around the Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl series, but it‚Äôs certainly possible to find late EX-series packs mixed in, particularly in certain batches of the product. These packs are more rare, but they add an exciting element for collectors hunting for EX-era cards.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re hoping for a specific set like EX, your odds are fairly low, but the possibility certainly exists!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s test! #\rI decided to purchase a Diamond \u0026amp; Pearl Trainer Kit from eBay. Snagged one from an auction for only\nWhen the package arrived, I carefully inspected the sealed product, scanning for any signs of wear or tampering. I wanted to ensure I wasn‚Äôt about to open something that had been messed with.\nWhilst inspecting, I noticed that the edge of the booster pack was visible through the side of the plastic. The light hit it just right, and I could make out enough of the artwork to start formulating a guess about which set it could be from.\nAfter a closer look at the booster pack‚Äôs art, I began comparing it with the different pack arts from all the sets we previously covered what it could be. There are a lot of possibilities, and I ended up thinking the pack featured Kabutops, The colors and design seemed to line up, and I grew confident that I had an EX Holon Phantoms pack in my hands.\nI decided to open the kit and record it for fun, sort of like a booster pack opening! You can watch the full opening on my YouTube:\nUnwrapping the kit, I was greeted with a surprise: it wasn‚Äôt Kabutops after all. Instead, the pack featured Zangoose!\nThough I had been wrong about the pack art, I wasn‚Äôt disappointed in the slightest! It was still an EX Holon Phantoms pack like i had hoped for, and it felt like a stroke of luck that I‚Äôd pulled a pack from this sought-after set. In the end, my guess had been close enough, and it was a fun experience learning about this product.\nHave thoughts or questions? Curious about this topic?

One of the most enduring aspects of collecting is the thrill of opening a sealed booster pack and wondering what treasures lie inside. But what if you could know what\u0026rsquo;s inside a pack before opening it? Techniques like pack weighing and pack searching have been around for years, and while they can be controversial, they also have a place in the modern collecting landscape especially when approached with transparency and integrity.\nWhat is Pack Weighing and Searching? #\rPack weighing refers to the practice of using a precision scale to determine the weight of a booster pack. The logic is simple: holographic cards (especially vintage ones) typically weigh more than common or non-holo cards. In sets like the original Base Set or Jungle, a \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo; pack often contains a holo rare card, while a \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; pack typically does not.\nPack searching is a broader term that can include weighing but also involves other non-invasive methods to guess pack contents. This might involve using a flashlight to shine through modern packs (where possible), feeling for card indentations, or even manipulating the orientation of packs to spot printing codes or manufacturing clues.\nWhy Is It Controversial? #\rMany collectors view these techniques as a form of unfair advantage, especially when packs are sold under the guise of being completely random. A buyer expects a 1 in 3 chance of pulling a holo rare in vintage sets‚Äînot a cherry-picked \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; pack sold at full price.\nWhen sellers weigh or search packs and don‚Äôt disclose this information, it creates mistrust in the community. Buyers may unknowingly purchase packs with drastically reduced chances of pulling high-value cards, undermining the excitement and perceived fairness of the experience.\nThe Case for Transparency #\rHere‚Äôs where the conversation shifts: transparency changes everything.\nIf a seller clearly discloses that a pack has been weighed, searched, or evaluated in any way, the buyer can make an informed decision. For example:\nA \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo; Base Set pack might be sold at a premium because it likely contains a holo. A \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; pack could be offered at a discounted rate for collectors who want a sealed product for display purposes. Packs could be listed with their exact weights and left up to the buyer to determine what that means for their collecting goals. This honesty builds trust in the seller and contributes to a healthier collecting ecosystem. In fact, there‚Äôs a growing niche of collectors who prefer to buy weighed or searched packs because it helps them curate their collection more precisely.\nEthical Reselling and Collector Trust #\rIf you‚Äôre someone who enjoys the science of pack weighing or has the tools to search packs non-invasively, there‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with that. The key is to communicate your methods clearly and allow your customers to decide for themselves.\nHere are a few tips for ethical reselling:\nLabel your listings accurately. Use terms like \u0026ldquo;heavy,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;light,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;searched\u0026rdquo; in your titles and descriptions. Provide exact weights and details of your methods when possible. Don‚Äôt reseal packs. Ever. Once a pack has been opened, it should never be sold as sealed. This is where ethical lines become non-negotiable. Educate your buyers. Not everyone knows what pack weighing is‚Äîoffering resources or explanations can help others learn and appreciate the honesty in your approach. Preserving the Fun of the Hobby #\rAt the end of the day, Pok√©mon is a hobby driven by passion, nostalgia, and connection. There‚Äôs room for different types of collectors: sealed collectors, players, casual fans, hardcore investors, and yes‚Äîeven data-driven enthusiasts who want to know exactly what they‚Äôre getting.\nBy being honest about pack conditions and weighing practices, sellers can help buyers make informed choices and preserve the integrity of the community. As long as the methods are disclosed and packs aren‚Äôt tampered with, these techniques can be tools of trust not deception.\nFinal Thoughts #\rWeighing and searching Pok√©mon booster packs might never be fully embraced by everyone in the community‚Äîbut with transparency, they don‚Äôt have to be taboo. When collectors and sellers treat each other with respect and honesty, even practices that were once frowned upon can become part of a trusted and informed hobby.\nWhether you‚Äôre the type to open packs for the thrill, display them sealed, or analyze every gram, the beauty of this hobby is that there‚Äôs room for all of us.\nHave thoughts or questions?

At the time, there was barely any information about it online, so I dug deeper and decided to create a post documenting the card on EliteFourum. That post gained significant attention within the collecting community. Some collectors had already noticed the variant and had been quietly acquiring them for years.\nThe new information I shared prompted more collectors to come forward with additional research and insights into this mysterious card. Eventually, this community effort led to collectors formally requesting that the grading company CGC recognize the variant using my article as a key reference point.\nThanks to the support of the collectors at EliteFourum and the research I contributed, CGC officially recognized the card as a variant on February 9th, 2021. They even published their own article on the subject, which you can read here:\nüëâ CGC article on the Black Flame Ninetales\nSince then the card has become more recognized in the community as well as other leading grading companies have officially recognized the variant too like PSA.\nI‚Äôm incredibly proud to have made a lasting impact on the Pok√©mon TCG community and grateful to the fellow collectors at EliteFourum who helped along the way.\nBelow is a copy of the original article I wrote five years ago. For more discussion and collector insights, I highly recommend checking out the original thread here:\nüîó The Black Flame Ninetales ‚Äì EliteFourum\nOriginal Article (October 2020) #\rThe Black Flame Ninetales #\rFor those that are seeing this for the first time it‚Äôs an Unlimited Base Set Ninetales (12/102) but the flame around Ninetales is black instead of purple.\n(See side by side comparison below)\nAfter searching ebay for a few month‚Äôs checking every Ninetales card listed i managed to find one on a BIN and scooped it up, Having it in hand i was now determined to find out some more information about it starting with evidence of it being pulled from a pack.\nIt took a while searching through pack opening videos for every time a Ninetales was pulled but i finally found one being pulled from 6 years a go!\nPrimetimePokemon‚Äôs Pull (Timestamp: 10:52)\rSee also LeonHart‚Äôs pack opening video found by @jkanly\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0MU7sAmMVY\nYou can see in these video‚Äôs that the Booster Packs being opened are;\nIdentifying Shadowless \u0026amp; Unlimited Base set Boxes \u0026amp; Packs\nMade in the U.S.A., ‚Äú1999-2000‚Äù copywrites, Short seal pack: There is no evidence this card comes from any other pack as of yet.\nError or Variant? #\rMy initial theory was that it‚Äôs an error card since the packs it comes from are a late print of Unlimited but the Black Flame is not present on previous print runs of Unlimited, leading me to speculate that it was a possible printing error.\nHowever keep in mind that a 1999-2000 Base Set Booster Pack is not guaranteed to have a 1999-2000 print Holo card inside, it has been rumoured that the non-2000 print holo‚Äôs inside the packs are old stock, Possibly from an early print run of Unlimited. This would make the most sense as the Black Flame Ninetales shares it‚Äôs black flame with the Shadowless \u0026amp; 1st Edition versions and it is also not a 1999-2000 print holo.\nAdditional Information #\rThe black flame is also clearly visible on all 1st Edition, Shadowless, Japanese Base Set \u0026amp; Evolutions Ninetales as well. These are the only other prints that contain the black flame that i have found. All other Languages of Unlimited Base Set as well as the 1999-2000 Print, Base Set 2 \u0026amp; Legendary Collection Ninetales have the purple flame.\nI would still love to find out more about this card. If you know any more information about it or have some theories please share! There is still a ton i don‚Äôt know but i am grateful for the efour community teaching me new things daily so please let me know if anything is wrong \u0026amp; i will correct it.

One of the coolest things to collect is signed Pok√©mon cards that bear the signature of an artist, player, or notable figure in the Pok√©mon TCG community.\nRecently, I wanted to extract a signature from a signed card and create a clean digital version of it to use in editing images and backgrounds.\nThe chosen signature was the classic Mitsuhiro Arita Charizard.\nHere‚Äôs how I did it!\nStep 1: Finding the Signed Pok√©mon Card #\rThe first step was to find an image of a signed Pok√©mon card. After searching online, I found a good enough image of the signature I was looking for on eBay. I downloaded the image and prepared it for editing.\nStep 2: Cropping the Signature Using GIMP #\rOnce I had the image, I opened it in GIMP, a free and powerful image editing tool. To isolate the signature, I used the crop tool to cut out the portion of the image that contained just the signature. I then saved the cropped image as a PNG file.\nStep 3: Using Hugging Face Gemini for Image Editing #\rTo cleanly extract the signature from the background, I used Google\u0026rsquo;s AI Studio with the Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental model.\nThere is also a model you can test with over on Hugging Face.\nWith a simple prompt, I instructed the AI to remove everything except the signature and place it on a white background. It took a few tweaks to get the prompt right in the end and i\u0026rsquo;ll only share an imperfect output with a watermark to prevent nefarious use.\nI used the following prompt for this:\nEnhance the given signature by placing it on a pure white background. Maintain the original signature\u0026#39;s style, sharpness, and details while ensuring clean, crisp edges. Remove any noise or unwanted artifacts for a smooth and professional look. The result should be high-resolution and easy to edit. The lines are from a single black pen mark. After processing, Gemini generated a new image featuring only the signature on a plain white background.\nStep 4: Refining the Image in GIMP #\rWith the extracted signature on a white background, I opened the image in GIMP again.\nThis time, I used the color-to-alpha tool to remove the white background, leaving only the signature on a transparent background.\nThis final touch made the signature ready to use in digital designs or overlays.\nEditor\u0026rsquo;s Note: OpenAI has since released their 4o image generation model with the capabilties of producing transparent images so this step may be covered with some extra prompt work.\rFinal Thoughts #\rThis process was surprisingly straightforward and effective! By combining GIMP with AI-powered tools, I was able to extract and clean up the signature with precision.\nWhile the output image i have shared isn\u0026rsquo;t a complete 1:1 copy, you can refine the prompt a little more to get a better replica.\nIf you are thinking about nefarious ways to use this information STOP IT NOW! This was just a fun side project \u0026amp; learning experience for me.\nPSA: I fully recognize that publishing this may lead to this information falling into the wrong hands, However i believe it is better to alert the broader public rather than this technology be discovered and kept private. You should always be extra vigilante and do plenty of research when dealing with signed cards. I can only imagine fakes will be getting harder to detect with the advancements in AI!\nAuthor Notes: While making this blog post i needed a way of watermarking my edited images so i created this python script to add the watermark for me automatically on a batch of images.\rHave thoughts or questions?

From the schoolyards of the late 90s to the high-stakes auction houses of today, this fiery lizard has captivated hearts and wallets like no other. But what makes the Base Set Charizard, and its many successors, so special? Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the history and cultural impact of the card that arguably defines Pok√©mon TCG collecting.\nThe Spark: Base Set Origins (1999) #\rWhen the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game launched internationally in 1999, based on the already wildly popular video games, kids were instantly hooked. Among the 102 cards in the Base Set, one stood out. Illustrated by the legendary Mitsuhiro Arita, the holographic Charizard card (#4/102) wasn\u0026rsquo;t just powerful in playground battles (though its 120 HP and Fire Spin attack felt immense); it was visually stunning. The holo pattern, the imposing dragon-like pose, and the sheer cool factor made it the card everyone wanted to pull from a booster pack. Its relative rarity compared to other holos cemented its status as the ultimate prize.\nMore Than Just Cardboard: Cultural Significance #\rThe Base Set Charizard quickly transcended the game itself. It became a status symbol on the playground, a mythical treasure whispered about in hushed tones. Finding one felt like striking gold. This initial hype created a ripple effect that continues today. News stories about high-value Charizard sales, celebrity collectors showcasing their graded copies (looking at you, Logan Paul!), and the sheer nostalgia associated with it have kept Charizard in the cultural zeitgeist. It represents the peak of the initial Pok√©mon craze for many and serves as a tangible link to childhood memories.\nStill Burning Bright: Modern Charizard Chase Cards #\rWizards of the Coast, and later The Pok√©mon Company International, understood Charizard\u0026rsquo;s appeal. Throughout the TCG\u0026rsquo;s history, new Charizard cards have consistently been featured as powerful, rare, and highly desirable \u0026lsquo;chase\u0026rsquo; cards in new sets. From the early Neo Destiny\u0026rsquo;s Shining Charizard to modern behemoths like the Charizard VMAX from Champion\u0026rsquo;s Path, the Rainbow Rare Charizard VSTAR from Brilliant Stars, or the Special Illustration Rare Charizard ex from Obsidian Flames, pulling a top-tier Charizard remains a set-defining moment for collectors.\nThese modern iterations often feature stunning alternate artwork, intricate textures, and competitive viability, ensuring that Charizard isn\u0026rsquo;t just a relic of the past but an ongoing force in the collecting world. The constant reinvention keeps the flame alive for both nostalgic collectors and new fans entering the hobby.\nThe Undisputed King #\rCharizard\u0026rsquo;s reign is a unique blend of factors: nostalgic power from its Base Set debut, striking artwork, perceived TCG strength (especially early on), consistent high-rarity reprints, and significant cultural entrenchment. It\u0026rsquo;s the card that introduced many to the concept of \u0026ldquo;chase cards\u0026rdquo; and remains the benchmark against which other popular Pok√©mon cards are often measured. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re hunting for the original grail or chasing the latest secret rare, the Charizard phenomenon shows no signs of cooling down. It truly is the undisputed king of Pok√©mon cards.\n","date":"1 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/the-charizard-phenomenon/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Charizard Phenomenon","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
