One of the most enduring aspects of collecting is the thrill of opening a sealed booster pack and wondering what treasures lie inside. But what if you could know what\u0026rsquo;s inside a pack before opening it? Techniques like pack weighing and pack searching have been around for years, and while they can be controversial, they also have a place in the modern collecting landscape especially when approached with transparency and integrity.\nWhat is Pack Weighing and Searching? #\rPack weighing refers to the practice of using a precision scale to determine the weight of a booster pack. The logic is simple: holographic cards (especially vintage ones) typically weigh more than common or non-holo cards. In sets like the original Base Set or Jungle, a \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo; pack often contains a holo rare card, while a \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; pack typically does not.\nPack searching is a broader term that can include weighing but also involves other non-invasive methods to guess pack contents. This might involve using a flashlight to shine through modern packs (where possible), feeling for card indentations, or even manipulating the orientation of packs to spot printing codes or manufacturing clues.\nWhy Is It Controversial? #\rMany collectors view these techniques as a form of unfair advantage, especially when packs are sold under the guise of being completely random. A buyer expects a 1 in 3 chance of pulling a holo rare in vintage sets—not a cherry-picked \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; pack sold at full price.\nWhen sellers weigh or search packs and don’t disclose this information, it creates mistrust in the community. Buyers may unknowingly purchase packs with drastically reduced chances of pulling high-value cards, undermining the excitement and perceived fairness of the experience.\nThe Case for Transparency #\rHere’s where the conversation shifts: transparency changes everything.\nIf a seller clearly discloses that a pack has been weighed, searched, or evaluated in any way, the buyer can make an informed decision. For example:\nA \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo; Base Set pack might be sold at a premium because it likely contains a holo. A \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; pack could be offered at a discounted rate for collectors who want a sealed product for display purposes. Packs could be listed with their exact weights and left up to the buyer to determine what that means for their collecting goals. This honesty builds trust in the seller and contributes to a healthier collecting ecosystem. In fact, there’s a growing niche of collectors who prefer to buy weighed or searched packs because it helps them curate their collection more precisely.\nEthical Reselling and Collector Trust #\rIf you’re someone who enjoys the science of pack weighing or has the tools to search packs non-invasively, there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. The key is to communicate your methods clearly and allow your customers to decide for themselves.\nHere are a few tips for ethical reselling:\nLabel your listings accurately. Use terms like \u0026ldquo;heavy,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;light,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;searched\u0026rdquo; in your titles and descriptions. Provide exact weights and details of your methods when possible. Don’t reseal packs. Ever. Once a pack has been opened, it should never be sold as sealed. This is where ethical lines become non-negotiable. Educate your buyers. Not everyone knows what pack weighing is—offering resources or explanations can help others learn and appreciate the honesty in your approach. Preserving the Fun of the Hobby #\rAt the end of the day, Pokémon is a hobby driven by passion, nostalgia, and connection. There’s room for different types of collectors: sealed collectors, players, casual fans, hardcore investors, and yes—even data-driven enthusiasts who want to know exactly what they’re getting.\nBy being honest about pack conditions and weighing practices, sellers can help buyers make informed choices and preserve the integrity of the community. As long as the methods are disclosed and packs aren’t tampered with, these techniques can be tools of trust not deception.\nFinal Thoughts #\rWeighing and searching Pokémon booster packs might never be fully embraced by everyone in the community—but with transparency, they don’t have to be taboo. When collectors and sellers treat each other with respect and honesty, even practices that were once frowned upon can become part of a trusted and informed hobby.\nWhether you’re the type to open packs for the thrill, display them sealed, or analyze every gram, the beauty of this hobby is that there’s room for all of us.\nHave thoughts or questions?

At the time, there was barely any information about it online, so I dug deeper and decided to create a post documenting the card on EliteFourum. That post gained significant attention within the collecting community. Some collectors had already noticed the variant and had been quietly acquiring them for years.\nThe new information I shared prompted more collectors to come forward with additional research and insights into this mysterious card. Eventually, this community effort led to collectors formally requesting that the grading company CGC recognize the variant using my article as a key reference point.\nThanks to the support of the collectors at EliteFourum and the research I contributed, CGC officially recognized the card as a variant on February 9th, 2021. They even published their own article on the subject, which you can read here:\n👉 CGC article on the Black Flame Ninetales\nSince then the card has become more recognized in the community as well as other leading grading companies have officially recognized the variant too like PSA.\nI’m incredibly proud to have made a lasting impact on the Pokémon TCG community and grateful to the fellow collectors at EliteFourum who helped along the way.\nBelow is a copy of the original article I wrote five years ago. For more discussion and collector insights, I highly recommend checking out the original thread here:\n🔗 The Black Flame Ninetales – EliteFourum\nOriginal Article (October 2020) #\rThe Black Flame Ninetales #\rFor those that are seeing this for the first time it’s an Unlimited Base Set Ninetales (12/102) but the flame around Ninetales is black instead of purple.\n(See side by side comparison below)\nAfter searching ebay for a few month’s checking every Ninetales card listed i managed to find one on a BIN and scooped it up, Having it in hand i was now determined to find out some more information about it starting with evidence of it being pulled from a pack.\nIt took a while searching through pack opening videos for every time a Ninetales was pulled but i finally found one being pulled from 6 years a go!\nPrimetimePokemon’s Pull (Timestamp: 10:52)\rSee also LeonHart’s pack opening video found by @jkanly\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0MU7sAmMVY\nYou can see in these video’s that the Booster Packs being opened are;\nIdentifying Shadowless \u0026amp; Unlimited Base set Boxes \u0026amp; Packs\nMade in the U.S.A., “1999-2000” copywrites, Short seal pack: There is no evidence this card comes from any other pack as of yet.\nError or Variant? #\rMy initial theory was that it’s an error card since the packs it comes from are a late print of Unlimited but the Black Flame is not present on previous print runs of Unlimited, leading me to speculate that it was a possible printing error.\nHowever keep in mind that a 1999-2000 Base Set Booster Pack is not guaranteed to have a 1999-2000 print Holo card inside, it has been rumoured that the non-2000 print holo’s inside the packs are old stock, Possibly from an early print run of Unlimited. This would make the most sense as the Black Flame Ninetales shares it’s black flame with the Shadowless \u0026amp; 1st Edition versions and it is also not a 1999-2000 print holo.\nAdditional Information #\rThe black flame is also clearly visible on all 1st Edition, Shadowless, Japanese Base Set \u0026amp; Evolutions Ninetales as well. These are the only other prints that contain the black flame that i have found. All other Languages of Unlimited Base Set as well as the 1999-2000 Print, Base Set 2 \u0026amp; Legendary Collection Ninetales have the purple flame.\nI would still love to find out more about this card. If you know any more information about it or have some theories please share! There is still a ton i don’t know but i am grateful for the efour community teaching me new things daily so please let me know if anything is wrong \u0026amp; i will correct it. Finally i encourage you to check through your binders to see if you have one of these super rare Ninetales and share it below 😄\nThanks to: #\r@alovell – for sharing his thread were he found one of these error’s. @jkanly – for his brilliant guide helping me determine which packs the error comes from. PrimetimePokemon – for opening a Base Booster Box 6 years ago. @fritz – for getting the first ever Black Flame Ninetales graded with CGC as well as his YouTube video about this card.

One of the coolest things to collect is signed Pokémon cards that bear the signature of an artist, player, or notable figure in the Pokémon TCG community.\nRecently, I wanted to extract a signature from a signed card and create a clean digital version of it to use in editing images and backgrounds.\nThe chosen signature was the classic Mitsuhiro Arita Charizard.\nHere’s how I did it!\nStep 1: Finding the Signed Pokémon Card #\rThe first step was to find an image of a signed Pokémon card. After searching online, I found a good enough image of the signature I was looking for on eBay. I downloaded the image and prepared it for editing.\nStep 2: Cropping the Signature Using GIMP #\rOnce I had the image, I opened it in GIMP, a free and powerful image editing tool. To isolate the signature, I used the crop tool to cut out the portion of the image that contained just the signature. I then saved the cropped image as a PNG file.\nStep 3: Using Hugging Face Gemini for Image Editing #\rTo cleanly extract the signature from the background, I used Google\u0026rsquo;s AI Studio with the Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental model.\nThere is also a model you can test with over on Hugging Face.\nWith a simple prompt, I instructed the AI to remove everything except the signature and place it on a white background. It took a few tweaks to get the prompt right in the end and i\u0026rsquo;ll only share an imperfect output with a watermark to prevent nefarious use.\nI used the following prompt for this:\nEnhance the given signature by placing it on a pure white background. Maintain the original signature\u0026#39;s style, sharpness, and details while ensuring clean, crisp edges. Remove any noise or unwanted artifacts for a smooth and professional look. The result should be high-resolution and easy to edit. The lines are from a single black pen mark. After processing, Gemini generated a new image featuring only the signature on a plain white background.\nStep 4: Refining the Image in GIMP #\rWith the extracted signature on a white background, I opened the image in GIMP again.\nThis time, I used the color-to-alpha tool to remove the white background, leaving only the signature on a transparent background.\nThis final touch made the signature ready to use in digital designs or overlays.\nEditor\u0026rsquo;s Note: OpenAI has since released their 4o image generation model with the capabilties of producing transparent images so this step may be covered with some extra prompt work.\rFinal Thoughts #\rThis process was surprisingly straightforward and effective! By combining GIMP with AI-powered tools, I was able to extract and clean up the signature with precision.\nWhile the output image i have shared isn\u0026rsquo;t a complete 1:1 copy, you can refine the prompt a little more to get a better replica.\nIf you are thinking about nefarious ways to use this information STOP IT NOW! This was just a fun side project \u0026amp; learning experience for me.\nPSA: I fully recognize that publishing this may lead to this information falling into the wrong hands, However i believe it is better to alert the broader public rather than this technology be discovered and kept private. You should always be extra vigilante and do plenty of research when dealing with signed cards. I can only imagine fakes will be getting harder to detect with the advancements in AI!\nAuthor Notes: While making this blog post i needed a way of watermarking my edited images so i created this python script to add the watermark for me automatically on a batch of images.\rHave thoughts or questions?

From the schoolyards of the late 90s to the high-stakes auction houses of today, this fiery lizard has captivated hearts and wallets like no other. But what makes the Base Set Charizard, and its many successors, so special? Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the history and cultural impact of the card that arguably defines Pokémon TCG collecting.\nThe Spark: Base Set Origins (1999) #\rWhen the Pokémon Trading Card Game launched internationally in 1999, based on the already wildly popular video games, kids were instantly hooked. Among the 102 cards in the Base Set, one stood out. Illustrated by the legendary Mitsuhiro Arita, the holographic Charizard card (#4/102) wasn\u0026rsquo;t just powerful in playground battles (though its 120 HP and Fire Spin attack felt immense); it was visually stunning. The holo pattern, the imposing dragon-like pose, and the sheer cool factor made it the card everyone wanted to pull from a booster pack. Its relative rarity compared to other holos cemented its status as the ultimate prize.\nMore Than Just Cardboard: Cultural Significance #\rThe Base Set Charizard quickly transcended the game itself. It became a status symbol on the playground, a mythical treasure whispered about in hushed tones. Finding one felt like striking gold. This initial hype created a ripple effect that continues today. News stories about high-value Charizard sales, celebrity collectors showcasing their graded copies (looking at you, Logan Paul!), and the sheer nostalgia associated with it have kept Charizard in the cultural zeitgeist. It represents the peak of the initial Pokémon craze for many and serves as a tangible link to childhood memories.\nStill Burning Bright: Modern Charizard Chase Cards #\rWizards of the Coast, and later The Pokémon Company International, understood Charizard\u0026rsquo;s appeal. Throughout the TCG\u0026rsquo;s history, new Charizard cards have consistently been featured as powerful, rare, and highly desirable \u0026lsquo;chase\u0026rsquo; cards in new sets. From the early Neo Destiny\u0026rsquo;s Shining Charizard to modern behemoths like the Charizard VMAX from Champion\u0026rsquo;s Path, the Rainbow Rare Charizard VSTAR from Brilliant Stars, or the Special Illustration Rare Charizard ex from Obsidian Flames, pulling a top-tier Charizard remains a set-defining moment for collectors.\nThese modern iterations often feature stunning alternate artwork, intricate textures, and competitive viability, ensuring that Charizard isn\u0026rsquo;t just a relic of the past but an ongoing force in the collecting world. The constant reinvention keeps the flame alive for both nostalgic collectors and new fans entering the hobby.\nThe Undisputed King #\rCharizard\u0026rsquo;s reign is a unique blend of factors: nostalgic power from its Base Set debut, striking artwork, perceived TCG strength (especially early on), consistent high-rarity reprints, and significant cultural entrenchment. It\u0026rsquo;s the card that introduced many to the concept of \u0026ldquo;chase cards\u0026rdquo; and remains the benchmark against which other popular Pokémon cards are often measured. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re hunting for the original grail or chasing the latest secret rare, the Charizard phenomenon shows no signs of cooling down. It truly is the undisputed king of Pokémon cards.\n","date":"24 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/the-charizard-phenomenon/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Charizard Phenomenon","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
